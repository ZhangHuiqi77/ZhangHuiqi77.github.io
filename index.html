          <p>This weekend, I immersed in the stories of three women. </p>
<p>Lisa Su.<br>CEO of AMD, MIT PhD. I watched her talk in MIT and a video about her and AMD. She is strong, full of logic and very smart. Her advice to the MIT PhDs: Be in Good mindset, perserverance, creative, we can make our luck. She is very confident about be a professionist is good in business than a generalist, like Harvard MBA. She also said it is really tough in MIT. She really saw what really smart is. I think tough make people strong. See smart make people smart and humble. Obviousely, Lisa and Huang can double win in the AI era. </p>
<p>Feifei Li.<br>AI starter, professor in Stanford.<br>She is really a risk taker. I do understand that how many people say no to her idea about building a 10 million image dataset. It is very common as a scientist that the idea is not accepted and supported by others. And she met some general and specific problems, grant, having kids, feel frastrated about potential wrong leading, the sense of this dataset, etc.. I can see her story telling is very attractive. </p>
<p>black women movie<br>I watched a movie, ‘The Help’. It tells a story about a white girl interviewed many black maids and want to help people know their suffer. Black maids are integrity and clever too. It is very touched to see that people become more respectful and become real people. The man in the movie judged the girl that ‘initially it is nothing, but why you write the book’. In his mind, the unfair is a normal thing. I am glad they two hate each other. I am more glad that the girl’s mother beat Hilly in her way and feel proud of her daughter. I think she woke up her human nature, showing integrity and bravery. Women help women. Brava!</p>

          <p>We always hear: keep doing and you will get a lot. This is actually describe the benefit from compounding interest, in other words, power of time. But it is not intuitive how much I can get. If not clear enough, our brain will not set the specific goal and really make it. To specify this effect, let’s apply it in calculating the retirement saving. If you can put the specific amount of money (here 50k) every year with specific compounding interest (here 3% per year) until you are 55 years old (here start saving at 2 years old). Let’s see.</p>
<p>First, creat a class called power_of_time, it can also be used to minic compounding interet effect of doing exercise, writing, reading, etc…</p>

<p>So if I save 50k per year from I am 27 with 3% interest rate, I will have 2328800 when I am 55, 1.606 times of initial saving money!<br>I think precisely know the benefit will make people feel more safety when they save and spend money. And every time when saving, the reward of doing so is amplified, because oringinally it could happen after like 30 years! This positive feedback make people easier to persist and enjoy the moment. </p>
<p>I want to make the ‘power_of_time’ class be applied more in my life. In addition, about object-oriented programming, it is better for an object, which have many properties and also some specific methods. ‘Class’ is easy to expand and also do team coding. Usually use ‘handle’ when define it, so the changing of properties will be assigned to the initial. Properties, as the name, show the properties of the object. And methods could be many functions that can be used to the object. Usually the first function is to generate an example of the class, obj, and meanwhile initialize the properties.</p>

          <p>Basically, conda is a tool to manage virtual environments, which can have different versions of python or other packages. ‘Virtual’ is not really virtual. It actually installed the needed packages in different path. ipython is an interactive python terminal, which is based on python interpreter (can be understanded as python.exe in base or one vertual environment). spyder is a platform to write script, run code in console, check variables in the workspace, etc.. It also runs based on a python interpreter and specific environment. Only need to install spyder in the base, then install spyder kernels for the environment and edit the python interpreter and start new kernel in the launched spyder. </p>
<p>So the basic steps of setting a new environment is to 1. create env, 2. install packages and ipython. 3. set the python interpreter and console in spyder. Also, after creating environment, need to add the path to the environment variables in the windows “advanced system setting” (C:\Users\zhang\anaconda3\envs\tf\Lib\site-packages, C:\Users\zhang\anaconda3\envs\tf\Lib, C:\Users\zhang\anaconda3\envs\tf\Scripts, C:\Users\zhang\anaconda3\envs\tf\Library, C:\Users\zhang\anaconda3\envs\tf\Library\bin). </p>
<p>These days, I am trying to analyze the behavioral structure based on the DLC tracking data. Some machine learning methods need to be used. Here, just wrote down some experience of packages install. On the one hand, I am using VAME, which do RNN and autoencoder under the pytorch structure and some visualization tool, like umap. On the other hand, I will use tensorflow LSTM. To manage packages, I create Anaconda environments on Windows 10 for both. Actually I did on two PCs, VAME on the GPU and tensorflow on my laptop (only CPU).</p>
<pre><code># if you tried the same env with similar name before but it does not work, can clear it in conda prompt before try new one.
conda remove --name tf-cpu --all</code></pre><p>After create the environment, activate it and install packages. For VAME install, follow the instruction on their github, then edit the error according to error info. Usually some text error, like in the yaml config file, “sklearn” need to change to “scikit-learn”. The same problem also need to be editted in the installation file, here it is ‘setup.py’. Then when it installed umap, the eroor is sth like “importlib.metadata can not be found” and it is point to the umap <strong>init</strong> file. I checked the importlib.metadata, and it is really not easy to found by eye that for python versions earlier than 3.8, this package is importlib_metadata ( _ there but not .). I did install importlib_metadata and importlib-metadata, so I change the . to _ then it work. I would see some <strong>tiny difference of text</strong>, because they update new versions and have new dependencies quickly.</p>
<p>For tensorflow installation:</p>
<pre><code># In conda prompt, create a new environment for tf. 
conda create --name tf
activate tf
conda search tensorflow # search for the available version of tf in anaconda, then choose the version you like
conda install tensorflow=2.10.0
conda install ipython # install ipython for this environment, so I can enter ipython not enter the base env ipython
pip install spyder-kernels==2.2.* # install kernels for using this virtual env in spyder

# after install, can test in the ipython and spyder
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)</code></pre><p>To work on the tf env in spyder, activate the env in conda, then launch spyder by click, and in spyder, go to tools -&gt; preference -&gt; Python interpreter -&gt; change it to the path of python.exe in the virtual env (C:/Users/zhang/anaconda3/envs/tf/python.exe). Then start a new console under this interpreter.</p>

          <p>proof by contradiction (反证法)<br>The statement is: There are infinite prime numbers(质数有无限多个)</p>
<p>Assume that there are limited prime numbers，p1, p2, …, pr in order<br>Then there is a number p = p1<em>p2</em>… * pr + 1,<br>As pr is the biggest prime number, so p is not prime number. Then p should be rewriten as the multiplication of the existed prime numbers. But the given expression of p show it cannot. Because it is with a +1.<br>the assumption is wrong.<br>Proved! there are infinite prime numbers. </p>
<p>There are also an interesting story in this chapter. Holmes and Watson go camping and slept in a tent. At midnight, Holmes wake up and asked Watson to tell him what did her see. Watson looked at the beautiful sky and answered very detailed inference according to her rich knowledge about stars, constellation, astronomy, meteorology and time. She was very proud of herself and asked back what did Holmes see. Holmes wry smiled and said, Waston you idiot, it means our camp was stolen. </p>
<p>I leared that to proof a statement, can create a variable based on the constrain and well-known truth, then try to overthrow the opposite statement. <strong>Creat the variable</strong> is the important step in the whole process! Can try in other questions. </p>
<p>I am always thinking, mathematic statement are based on the answer is just yes or no. But like in neuroscience, the questions are complex, “high dimensional”. For example, does APC helpful in treating epilepsy? This question is still too broad. To narrow down, we can ask: does APC helpful in rescueing recurrent seizures in the KA model? Then, to find the answer, we need to manipulate the APC, which means there are detailed choices, electrical stimulation, chemogenetics, optogenetics, pharmalogical approaches. We can then narrow down the hypothesis or statement to “inhibiting APC by chemogenetically activating PV interneurons is helpful in rescueing recurrent seizures in the KA model.” Then the animal model can be built and the manipulation can be executed. Then it need a reliable way to assess the recurrent seizures. So we record and analyze the EEG. The results show that seizures get less, which is contradict to the contradictory statement “inhibiting APC by chemogenetically activating PV interneurons is NOT helpful in rescueing recurrent seizures in the KA model.” So we proved our initial statement.<br>It seems just play with the words of direct proof and proof by contradiction. we don’t even need to create new variables. If we think of it in the another way, we exciting APC and record the seizures and found that exciting APC do make seizure worse. We still cannot say inhibiting APC can improve seizure. It seems narrow down to specific question and direct proof is dominant.</p>

          <p>每年的小作文都要迟到一些，去年甚至没写。这里一块回顾一下吧 (自认为记性很好hahaha)</p>
<p>2022 是非常特殊的一年，处在疫情笼罩下已经第三年，政策不稳定没有人知道还要持续多久。好在我有稳定的学习研究环境。年初3个月，我安排紧凑的完成了learning课题的实验，并用我的数据分析技能快速的拿到了一些结论。确实感受到了play with data的快乐。再次验证了从data -&gt; result -&gt; knowledge 的转化不是那么轻松的。4月起开始弄D4课题的急性记录的分析，可以说是两周之内完成雏形并进行了一次优化，拿出了图。我对自己handle数据的能力更加自信了。后面在一定的压力下，不得不转而开始弄战线拉的很长的PV癫痫课题。用整个5月加入了功能连接这部分的分析。6月反思发现错误并完善了一次。兴奋和不确定并行，体会颇深。7，8月完成了初稿，同时和导师讨论后补了几次实验。9月补了一批记录。这些过程我深刻的理解到知识是怎么来的，用多个指标，多次实验验证自己的结论，并且把它放到一个大的科研背景下去考虑。并行而来的是从6月开始计划的康奈尔之行。得到了两边导师和同学（穗红）的很多帮助。有了大致的规划。10月开始了我的第一次一个人出国游学。三个月以来认识了康村NBB的一批新同学，Xinyue, LiuCan, Hongyu, Wenbo, Zhilei, Wenshuai, Yating, Heidi, Jason, 还有可爱又成熟的武汉小妹妹Alicia和一个陌生人ABC。 和每个同学的交流都让我受益匪浅。有些人哪怕没有深入交流，我也感受到了他们生活的气质和自信，比如David实验室的几位本科生。很开心的还有认识了几位爬山好友，文科生和理科生确实有着完全不同的生活和工作习惯。多了一丝对平行世界的人的了解和兴趣。康村超级棒，自信的Yapici， Linda和Aza，随性的Antonio，夸张且爱博眼球的Joe Fetro，精英气质侧漏的Jesse，很专业但是有点冷的Alex Kwan。最重要的是我的导师，非常高效善良，有点内向的David，还有他nice的家人们。另外还有来自南美洲朋友带给我的感动，热情随性且成熟的巴西室友和朋友们。华盛顿之行和夏村也收获多多，了解到了JC lab 的风格和在美国科研圈如何受到respect。 听到chuiwen, JC, 明娜这些人的故事本身就很棒。 听到了更多的研究，有些研究就是一听就很来电的感觉，比如Weinan的。康村的科研浇灌让我非常受益。回来后还参加了多人推荐的neuromatch。2022年我的科研训练确实走到了新的一步，写文章，开始思考presentation，认识同行（约30人）。现在看到每个人名我都能停下想想曾经的谈话和故事。短短3个月的离开，丰富了自己，增加了和两边导师的信任，也等来了开关。</p>
<p>2023年年初从美国回来后回家过年再回到香港已经2月（话说刚回香港也是奇妙的体验，喧嚣的街道，熟悉的湿热感和大巴车尾气，也有了晚上运动和恢复肌肉的一周。备份数据和报销等事务就同步完成了）。2月重启了我在香港的科研。为了找回状态，我用规律的时间完成了大量的果蝇课题的标注工作。并以此进入状态。文章的拒稿让我意识到，所有自己有疑惑的地方都会在审稿人眼里被放大。所以，最真实的面对自己的工作吧。2月中到3月我重构了代码，完成了新的记录数据的重新分析和数据展示。我当时对进度十分满意。4月开始构思PCA分析并开始了个导师的一对一meeting。4月其实花了三周在果蝇课题上，准备了四月底的那次presentation。也体会到了chatGPT在模块编程上的牛逼之处。3月4月和姐姐讨论了很多生成式AI的东西，感觉最强烈的时候每天都有一种焦虑和兴奋，感觉会有大事发生。5月从广州旅游回来之后我觉得很累，可能是感冒了。但是就慢慢进入状态分析了PCA。但是当时只是直觉让我这么做，还是没有想好怎么把这部分结果写进故事。6月我基本完成了文章修改。7月迎来了暑假，我参加了Neuromatch课程。这个暑营太充实了。感受到了共同学习的快乐！来自不同背景的同学们思考方式真的会不同，Linda，Park，Lacshana是很棒的共同学的伙伴。还有group coding的work方式。我觉得我提供了原始的idea，我的队友们非常高效的交流和工程化的实现了项目。Lily和Samuel做队友超级棒。我们的TA也是一个又cool又美的经历非常丰富的同学。3周扩展了computational neuroscience的了解，验证了自己的做项目思路，产生了DDM解释我的learning data的思路。由于7月的课程投稿也就耽误了。我们终于在8月中提交到了elife.这次我们没有得到很有效的意见。但是我自己很努力的想了所有能优化的地方，再加上8月底的心理课程，修改进度慢了挺多。终于再9月20号才完成提交，这次是JN。我们得到了一次很认真的审稿，模糊的东西都会在投稿中得到放大。虽然我不觉得审稿人在epilepsy方面很专业，但是他们确实提出了他们阅读中感到模糊的地方。这也促使我一条一条的去改进。我们是10月18号收到的拒稿回复。这是我第3次收到回复了，心态已然平和了很多。可以直接面对问题，想办法做或者改。此时离出发去SfN还剩3周。我在10月26号前除了心里酝酿如何改进之外，在做food learning grant review 相关的工作。后面就剩下两周了，主要修改了patch部分的分析。最后几天就要出发的时候，我完成了power部分的检查和分析，加入了z scale， 又重新分析了PCA，结果才终于确定。我到这时才觉得PCA真的是帮助到我们理解数据的，是很增色的一部分。最后几天快快的赶完poster甚至都没有时间练习。但是我觉得这两周非常高效。后面SfN阶段仿佛换了个人，丝毫不疲惫也没有时差，很兴奋的接受了大量的信息输入。和熟悉的同行加深交流，也认识了一些新同行。听着同龄人讲他们的工作，我觉得自己是快乐的，neuroscience是一个有趣的群体。对专业的excitation和mission有增无减。面对大佬James M的肯定确实是备受鼓舞。见到了康村的老朋友，听到他们的工作很快乐，可能对熟悉的人的工作也更容易产生连接吧。一周半的科研和旅游盛宴，新东西不断的撞击着我，产生着共鸣和新的连接。这感觉棒极了。11.20刚回来香港调时差休整的时候，我第一次面对挚爱的亲人的离世。恍然在11月底回到家中。已经10年没有在这个时间回家了。我的爷爷是全世界最棒的爷爷，死亡并不可怕，爷爷的善良，责任，远见，耐心已经深刻的刻印在我和姐姐的心里。知道死亡的平常，但是依然心疼被病痛折磨的没有尊严的爷爷。全家在一起，反思，深聊，眼泪让我们更加坚强。12月初再返回香港。经过一周心态调整，同时也整理和分享了SfN的收获，才再次回到投稿状态。其实只花了三天就改完了文章。和导师来往修改一轮，终于在冬至12.23这一天发出去了。每次投稿都让我用finally这个词，是因为多次的审核真是为了读者能体验好一点点。只有从对更大群体的价值我才能体会到做这件事的意义。在跨年之际，姐姐也要北上北京工作了。我们达成了一致： 拥抱变化。</p>
<p>这一年开启了一些新的习惯，听播客。现在这个大众创新的时代真不错，放学以后，硅谷101，Tianyu2FM, Lex Fridman, 无人知晓，知行小酒馆。带给我很多共鸣。播客往往是最快的新的思想，书给我稳定的内核。知行合一是最好的道路。感谢陪伴，分享，相互带来新奇体验的好友们！Let’s create more stories in the new year! </p>
<p>2024，来了</p>

          <p>This article is from Nature - light people, an interview of Prof. Eric Betzig. He tells us his “true life”, not just pass through. Nobel award, five children, science and technology, father’s company.</p>
<p>The interview is quite interesting.<br><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-023-01205-3#:~:text=Eric%20Betzig%2C%20who%20shared%20the,Bell%20Labs%20before%20turning%2035" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-023-01205-3#:~:text=Eric%20Betzig%2C%20who%20shared%20the,Bell%20Labs%20before%20turning%2035</a>.</p>
<p>The points hit me the most:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>cross-disciplines.</strong> But I find that the breakthroughs in science happen when people interact at the interface between very different disciplines that don’t necessarily have a clear connection. To this day, anything that I’ve succeeded within sciences is by getting out of my comfort zone and learning more about some field that has nothing to do with optics, and how optics can be applied to it.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>flexibly minded.</strong> You have to fill your mind with ideas and thoughts, and creatively think about how different things can be combined. I think that’s why I enjoyed working at Bell Labs so much, because it was a place where cell biologists, neurobiologists, computer scientists, material scientists all worked under the same roof and it was amazing what breakthroughs were made just having people talking to each other. So I want to warn against siloization in scientific research. Don’t just have people studying the same discipline in one institution, or don’t just have people chasing preset goals. Encourage outside thinkers. It’s good to have a goal, but you never know what’s gonna help you get to that goal. And sometimes goals may not have been intelligently chosen, and it can put blinders on you. You have to be flexibly minded in science.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>question and different disciplines.</strong> I believe to make a good scientific investigator, you need to be open-minded, and have the willingness and ability to talk to many other people of different disciplines, which is the secret to creativity and innovativeness. Knowing the problem is often half of the solution, so you should always have in your mind a set of important and impactful problems that you don’t know how to answer. Then, by putting yourself in a position where you are exposed to different people from different disciplines, you’ll find that creativity will come naturally because if you have the problem in your head, your subconscious starts to think about what you can do to solve this problem. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>work hard and success.</strong> To succeed, you just have to work really hard, make sure your brain is completely immersed in the problem or a number of problems, and then luck will come. But luck does not determine whether you’ll be successful. Hard work determines whether you’re going to be successful or not. Luck determines what you will be successful at. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>exponential curve of intelligence.</strong> It’s (the “It” is hard working) the only correlate I know to success. It has nothing to do with intelligence or where you’re working. It’s nonlinear, because the more you know, the more efficient you get in finding out even more. So it goes in pretty much an exponential curve, not a linear curve, with output.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>perseverance and quit.</strong> Perseverance doesn’t mean staying in the same job forever, nor does it mean focusing on the same problem, because sometimes problems have dead ends. Perseverance means focusing on the science or what motivates you in your career. I will agree that the hardest thing for me has been to know when to quit for exactly that reason because you’re taught: persevere, persevere, persevere. So it was a tough decision to quit Bell Labs and an even tougher decision to leave my dad’s company. At Bell Labs at least I knew that I had taken that near field technique as far as it could go. I knew that I wasn’t going to be able to break the laws of physics. So it wasn’t as difficult a decision to say, “Forget perseverance, I’m quitting there.” Because I felt like I had done everything I could do.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>risk takers and truly alive.</strong> When I ended my Nobel talk, I dedicated it to all the people who took a risk and failed, because though you don’t hear about them, they are more important because there’re more of them than people who took a risk and succeeded. You can go a whole career having a bunch of good half-baked ideas and never find the key. But I still encourage my students to take risks. When you take a risk, particularly a risk for your career, it usually brings out your best self. When you take a risk and initially fail, you’ll work your absolute hardest to try to succeed and that’s when you find your limits. It’s being alive, about being truly alive as opposed to kind of just passing through life.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>luck and scientific question.</strong> I felt I was very lucky to go to graduate school in 1982 and pick microscopy as a field. That was a lucky decision because it was right at the time that personal computers were available to automate microscopes, when the CCD chip was just becoming available, when fluorescence was starting to take off, and when lasers were cheap enough that they could go in individual labs. So being at the start of your career in 1980 and choosing microscopy is like being a physicist in 1920 and deciding to study quantum mechanics. That’s the way microscopy was in 1980, just a fruit waiting to be plucked. I was just lucky to have picked the right area.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>People are people.</strong> From a science side, I don’t really have a hero. One of the sobering things I feel about winning the Nobel Prize is I’ve had close contact with lots of famous people, scientists, politicians, etc. It’s scary how ordinary most of them seem. They’re not smarter. They’re not more beneficent. They don’t have deeper thoughts. They’re just people. People are people and whether they’re Nobel laureates, the President of the United States, or a billionaire, they’re all people and humans are very limited. Often, when people have success, they tend to forget their limitations, and extrapolate from their success in one area into expertise or proficiency in other areas in which they are not expert. I’m very cognizant of my many limitations, and the only time I’m willing to talk authoritatively is about microscopy because that’s the one area I feel like I’m competent to have an opinion on.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>talk to people with different background.</strong> How much do you hang out with chemists and biologists and data scientists and mathematicians and so forth? That’s why I always loved Bell Labs, where cell biologists, neurobiologists, computer scientists, material scientists all worked under the same roof and ate lunch together at the same table.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>risk, vigor and creativity.</strong> Don’t be afraid to take risks. There’s always a way to recover from a failure. Life is short, so live it with all the vigor and creativity you can.</p>
</li>

          <p>Although I did not have a Barbie doll when I was a child, I do know that Barbie doll is a perfect image for many girls. BTW, I have Panpan (my panda doll). Barbie movie shows two new sights - (1) what would a matriarchy world look like, Barbieland. (2) what would happen when the two world have interactions, including the effect on women (Barbie) and men (Ken) in the Barbieland And the effect on women (Gloria and Sasha) and men in power (Mattel people) in the real world. </p>
<p>At the start, the movie shows how the people’s life in the Barbieland look like. Barbies get up, dress up, make up, eat up and go to work. In that world, Barbies are very popular and respected. When I see Barbie can always say no to Ken and Kens are mouth fighting just for getting more attention from Barbies, I don’t know why I feel good. And then I realize something wrong in the Barbieland too. It shows exactly the opposite of some of our real world. In the Barbieland, most people do not have their “self”. They don’t have their own name and they all wear similar and dress up similar. Except Allan (Ken’s friend) and non-traditional Barbie. Allan is a special male charator. He seems well fitted in Barbie’s world and always know his self even when Barbie’s world is led by Kens. The non-traditional Barbie is a pecial female charator. She knows what happened to Barbie’s change (always want to die and the feet change) and how to fix it. She also not be brain washed by Kens. </p>
<p>When they go to the real world, Ken and Barbie feel totally different things. Barbie always want to fix the problem of the corresponding person in the real world. But Ken feels the happy from patriarchy. When they speak out their findings together, Ken immediately followed Barbie. He still think he is Barbie’s Ken. But the short experience in the real world is definitely a seed. He feels good about man’s power and go back to Baibie’s world before Barbie to construct Ken’s world. For Barbie, she is so upset in the real world, because she found it is not like what she thinks about. She is not popular, she is not respected, always get weird attention and actions. However, she met two people who are amazing for her. Both are old ladies. The first one show when Barbie is trying hard to connect to a person in the real world. After she think hard and felt the same pain from the real human and she wake up with tears. She see the old lady sits on the other end of the bench. Looks very calm and beautiful. Barbie tells her she lookes very beautiful. She smiled and said Yes. I think this is the first time that Barbie think that good about women in the real world can be good, not like what she experienced. Another lady is in the Mattel building, the old lady who saved Barbie and tell her she is beautiful. In the end of the movie, the lady shows up again. She is the creator of Barbie dolls. So when Ken in the real world, he found power. For Barbie, she found unperfectness.</p>
<p>When humans go to the Barbieland, the girl’s mom speak out the embarrassed situation of women in the real world. It is very tough in the real world. It seems everything women do is wrong. Need to be…, But not too… Her daughter and her think they hate each other in the real life, but when they are in very difficult cases, they have special chemistry. Sasha(the daughter) express her love to her mom (Gloria), telling her she is a hero, encouraging her to save Barbieland. So they together save Barbieland and also their own relationship. </p>
<p>For the Mattel people, it is ironically that they are in the high position but their behavior are funny and stereotyped. They are played by Barbie because they are too care about their appearance and their social identity. They also try to look nice to all people, which is for hiding the ugly and maintaining their power. In a short time that Ken experience in the real world, he finds even though it is Men’s world, no people cares Kens who has no special skills. The game of power is not fun at all. </p>
<p>It is ironic that human world and also barbieland is easy to show brain wash. Individual is not their “self”, they are just an object of the world. In the real world, even though people has their own name, own preference of clothes, make up, food and so on, it is also easy to follow the expectation of the society when choosing their life. More work or more family, more social or more self. Here are two very touched points about SELF. First, when Barbie experienced all, she sincerely says sorry to Ken because she always takes everything for granted before. And then Ken noticed that he is not Barbie’s Ken. Ken is just Ken. Another time I got teary eyes is that Barbie noticed that she can be a real human as long as she wants. No need any approvement. I think it is what the movie want to tell us. You have all your life. You are your SELF. </p>
<p>The movie shows new sights full of details. I strongly feel that communication is important in development. Communication always drives change. Problems are nowhere to hide. As long as people communicate in a rational way with respect, the things would be better. In the end of the movie, Barbie goes to the real world. She changes the name to Barbra and not wearing the typical pink. However, the first thing she do is to go to the gynecologist. Why? </p>
<p>(My guess is that Barbie is too curious about the women organ? Suppose that, a person can change to a bird, the first thing is the wings. If can change to a toy car, the first thing is the fast wheels. This shows the cute part of Barbie. Or maybe she want to have ability of having a baby.)</p>

          <p>‘Elemental’ is a great Disney movie. It tells a story about Be Yourself. The story happens in the world of elements, fire, water, gas, wood. The main charactor is a fire girl Ember. She fall in love with a water boy, Wade. They together save Ember’s father’s shop, during which Ember find she loves Wade and she learned how to express herself from him. For Wade, he was attracted and moved by Ember’s enthusiasm and confidence. They together make impossible to be possible. Usually fire and water are opposite, conflict and fight each other. Ember and Wade show big tension and how they can actually cooperate. </p>
<p>Except the central topic, these points also hit me:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>For ember’s parents, they know immigration would be hard and they were even not supported by their family and friends, but they still choose this. Because there exist unchangeable bad things in their hometown. They want to have a better life. Immigration is also for Ember. I feel that it is very similar in real life. Every country has its system defect. If the defect is not appropriate for a person, then the person may think about change, which usually need to face a great difficulty, like language, life style, acceptance. Also, in the immigration country, the local people also need to face some challenge from the immigrants. The bias come from their difference. The movie shows the inconvience of two so different people and also show amazing part. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The movie show many things that I think are like traditional Chinese stuff. Like the ceremony when Ember leave, the bow down to the ground. And a specific stuff means the continue of a family and career, like the blue lantern for Ember’s family. I actually don’t like these part in Chinese culture. But it shows in the Disney movie means that people around the world can understand these feelings. </p>
</li>
<li><p>When Ember and Wade are traped in the glass room and guard the blue lantern. Wade choose to sacrificed himself, be evaporated. Eventually he comes back! Water is stronger than what they look like. The similar thing for water and fire is they both are flexible and can be in any shape. But water also can change their state! Even if evaporated, they are still themself! </p>
</li>
<li><p>Be true self is not easy. A more common reason is that many voice comes and boo you, tell you you can not make it. So most people become what other people think about them. People all know growing up in the underrated condition is hard. But sometimes, it may even harder to grow up in the high expectations from people who love you. Because you care about them and want them be happy. So a smart way is to always be independent of other people’s thinking, always leave a space for youself. In addition, real love is to support, not to expect. </p>
</li>
</ol>

          <p>Odd and even feature is everywhere. We can alway separate the things to two catgories (A and none-A). That is the basic that we can define an absolute feature. For example, if we want to explain Left and Right in earth to an alien. We need to find a common Left/Right thing in both planets. I am very suprised to know this feature need to rely on parity non-conservation of weak interaction (宇称不守恒). This identified an constant direction. Then, we can also identify clockwise and counterclockwise. </p>
<p>Odd and even feature is a philosophy thought. It can help us simplify many questions. Because the two-choice decrease the dimension of the change. Here we can paly a game - guess the flipping coins. </p>
<ol>
<li>all coins are randomly placed with front up or bottom up. You have a look and turn around (You cannot see which coin is flipped by your friend then)</li>
<li>your friend is allowed to flip any coin once a time, but he need to report the flipping behavior when doing that.</li>
<li>your friend is asked to cover one coin with his hand. </li>
<li>the you can turn back and have a look. and tell people if the covered coin be flipped or not.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can address this problem by slighly remember the initial number of front-up coins. Then count the number of flipping. Then according to odd-even regularity, we can easily know if the odd-even feature of the front-up coins number should be change. </p>

<p>TaDa! The code is a little long, but very clear. </p>
<p>I play this with chatGPT(3.5). If I describe the whole rule and even a specific case to it. chatGPT said it do not know the answer. When I simply tell it I flip, for example 8 times, it will try to analyze the question by using the odd-even feature. But it still give a wrong anwer. It cannot generalize the question very well. Actually if I do not tell it the state of coins after flipping, it will never know how many coins should be head up. Only the odd-even feature would be conserved. But not the specific state. Details showed here: </p>
<p>1st play this game with chatGPT<br><strong>You:</strong></p>
<p>Hi, I want to play a game with you</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong></p>
<p>Of course! I’d be happy to play a game with you. What game would you like to play?</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>You:</strong></p>
<p>I have 5 coins. Now I will tell you they are head-up or tail-up. If it is head-up, I will use a 0, if tail-up I will use a 1. Initially, the states is 0 0 1 1 1. Now I flipped for 21 times. And I covered the forth coin so you cannot see it. What you see now is 0 0 1   1.  Do you think the forth coin is flipped ?</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong></p>
<p>Based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine with certainty whether the fourth coin has been flipped or not. Since you have flipped the coins 21 times and the information given is “0 0 1 1,” it indicates the outcome of the first three coins (head, head, tail), but the fourth coin’s outcome is unknown.<br>To determine the state of the fourth coin, we would need additional information such as the results of the additional flips or the specific rules you followed when covering the fourth coin. Without that information, it is impossible to determine whether the fourth coin has been flipped or not.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>You:</strong></p>
<p>Let me describe more detailed. I have 5 coins. Now I will tell you they are head-up or tail-up. If it is head-up, I will use a 0, if tail-up I will use a 1. Initially, the states is 0 0 1 0 1. Now I randomly flipped the coins, once a time. I totally flipped 21 times. Then, I covered the forth coin so you cannot see it. What you see now is 0 0 1 1.  Do you think the forth coin is flipped ?</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for providing more details. Based on the information you provided, we can make an educated guess about the state of the fourth coin.<br>Initially, the state of the coins is 0 0 1 0 1. After a total of 21 flips, you covered the fourth coin, and what I can see is 0 0 1 1.<br>Given that the first three coins were initially set to 0 0 1, we can conclude that they remained the same throughout the 21 flips. However, the state of the fourth coin (initially 0) is unknown because you covered it.<br>Therefore, it is not possible to definitively determine the state of the fourth coin without further information. It could be either flipped (1) or still in its initial state (0).</p>
<hr>
<p>2nd play with chatGPT<br><strong>You:</strong></p>
<p>I want to play a game with you</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong></p>
<p>Of course! I’d be happy to play a game with you. Please let me know which game you’d like to play or if you have any specific game in mind.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>You:</strong></p>
<p>I have 5 coins, 0 means front-up, 1 means bottom-up. Now I randomly place them on the table. And you are allowed to know which side is up. So for now, it is 0 0 1 0 1</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong></p>
<p>Great! I understand the setup. You have five coins, and the current configuration is: 0 0 1 0 1. You’re asking me to determine which side is up for each coin.<br>To clarify, when you say “0 means front-up, 1 means bottom-up,” do you mean that a “0” represents heads and a “1” represents tails?</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>You:</strong></p>
<p>yes, your understanding is right. If you do not have other problem, let go on</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for confirming. Let’s proceed with the game.<br>Based on the current configuration you provided (0 0 1 0 1), I will analyze each coin and determine the side that is facing up.<br>Analyzing the coins one by one:</p>
<ol>
<li>Coin 1: 0 (front-up or heads)</li>
<li>Coin 2: 0 (front-up or heads)</li>
<li>Coin 3: 1 (bottom-up or tails)</li>
<li>Coin 4: 0 (front-up or heads)</li>
<li>Coin 5: 1 (bottom-up or tails)</li>
</ol>
<p>So, according to my analysis, the current configuration is as follows:</p>
<p>Coin 1: Front-up or heads (0)
Coin 2: Front-up or heads (0)
Coin 3: Bottom-up or tails (1)
Coin 4: Front-up or heads (0)
Coin 5: Bottom-up or tails (1)</p>If my analysis is correct, these are the sides that are facing up for each coin. Let me know if I got it right!


<hr>
<p><strong>You:</strong></p>
<p>You are right. Now I will flip the coins for 8 times. Do you know how many coins would be front-up?</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I can help you determine the number of coins that would be front-up after flipping them 8 times.<br>Since each coin has two sides (front and bottom), flipping a coin essentially changes its current side. If a coin is currently front-up (0), flipping it will make it bottom-up (1), and vice versa.<br>To calculate the number of coins that would be front-up after 8 flips, we need to consider the initial configuration and the number of flips.<br>Based on the initial configuration you provided (0 0 1 0 1), we know that Coins 1, 2, and 4 are initially front-up (0), while Coins 3 and 5 are initially bottom-up (1).<br>Now, let’s consider the 8 flips. Each flip will change the side of a coin. Since there are 5 coins, we can calculate the number of front-up coins after 8 flips by looking at the remainder when dividing 8 by 2 (the number of sides).<br>8 divided by 2 equals 4 with no remainder. This means that after 8 flips, the pattern will repeat, and the same configuration as the initial state will be achieved. Therefore, the number of front-up coins after 8 flips will be the same as the initial number of front-up coins.<br>In the initial configuration, there are 3 front-up coins (Coins 1, 2, and 4). Therefore, after 8 flips, we can expect that 3 coins will still be front-up.<br>Please let me know if you have any further questions!</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>You:</strong></p>
<p>You are clever! but you got wrong. Let’s start again</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong></p>
<p>Apologies for the mistake. Let’s start again.<br>Based on the initial configuration of 0 0 1 0 1, and considering that you will now flip the coins 8 times, we can determine the number of coins that would be front-up.<br>To do this, we need to keep track of the flips and update the configuration after each flip. Let’s go step by step:<br>Initial configuration: 0 0 1 0 1</p>
<p>After 1st flip:
Coin 1: 1 (bottom-up or tails)
Coin 2: 1 (bottom-up or tails)
Coin 3: 0 (front-up or heads)
Coin 4: 1 (bottom-up or tails)
Coin 5: 0 (front-up or heads)</p><p>After 2nd flip:
Coin 1: 0 (front-up or heads)
Coin 2: 0 (front-up or heads)
Coin 3: 1 (bottom-up or tails)
Coin 4: 0 (front-up or heads)
Coin 5: 1 (bottom-up or tails)</p>Continuing this process, after 8 flips, we can determine the final configuration of the coins:
<p>Final configuration after 8 flips:
Coin 1: 1 (bottom-up or tails)
Coin 2: 1 (bottom-up or tails)
Coin 3: 0 (front-up or heads)
Coin 4: 1 (bottom-up or tails)
Coin 5: 0 (front-up or heads)</p>Now, let's count the number of front-up coins in the final configuration. We have 2 coins facing front-up (Coin 3 and Coin 5).
Therefore, after 8 flips, there would be 2 coins facing front-up.
I apologize for any confusion earlier. Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!
