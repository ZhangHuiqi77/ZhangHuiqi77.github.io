          <p>Now is less than 4 hours until 2025. It’s funny that this is the first time that I can write the annual review before the new year comes. </p>
<p>2024 is really a busy year (you know, final year PhD). The fly project got big progress this year in Mar and Apr. I am, again, back and forth between data and manuscript writing in May to Aug. Write hard is not like play hard and study hard. I need to have output. The truth is that writing is not a linear progress. Sometimes, I cannot have even one word output after a whole day hard working. Because it is about integrating results in mind and construct/imagine a story to make it make sense. Sometimes, reading paper is also distracting. But in total, I like writing, because it is a part to close the loop in research and really show people the work. In addition, I have to learn things from the rejection of the PV paper submission. Be concise, in-depth (not here and there), and write clearly (easy to read with no need to stop or go back to the previous sentence). </p>
<p>This year, AI is still a very hot topic, even hotter than 2023. I used AI a lot in research this year and talking to LLM robot has become a new habit. The feeling is amazing. I always feel that I learn things out of my expectation. I still do not have matured idea about how to study neuroAI, but I am sure the interest is getting stronger. First, neuroAI can be applying AI for neural data. Decoding, encoding, low-dimentional representation are widely used, which means that the data we collected from the brain region is enough to represent and convey the key parameter of the task. Some AI agent could manage to do the same task. But we still cannot explain what, how and why the brain model or the AI model works. Second, brain-inspired AI. This is a more difficult topic. At which level should we abstract concept and apply to improve or create algorithm would be important. Brain and general PC are naturally different. It is impossible and unnecessary for AI to mimic everything in brain. </p>
<p>As I am very close to graduate, I think it is fair to have some self-evaluation now. I have strong interst, motivation and capability to advancing a project. However, maybe I have too many interest and ideas and currently I can not judge which question is really important and which direction is really promising. </p>
<p>This year, I went to many new places<br>YunNan, snow mountain<br>Singapore, modernest city in Asia<br>Philippines, a poor but happy country, scuba diving</p>
<p>I learned new sports:<br>windsurfing<br>free diving</p>
<p>I was inspired by books and blogs<br>active inference<br>Li fei-fei autobiography<br>Elon Musk biography</p>
<p>I said goodbye to an intimate friend. There are a lot of memories and moments keep inspiring me. </p>
<p>wishes for 2025:<br>dream, clearify ideas and go for it<br>have more understanding of the finantial system and manage money well<br>travel to new countries<br>study philosophy</p>

          <p>These days are Norbel Prices days. I do get inspired by the scientists’ stories. </p>
<p>In the past paradigm of scientific findings, interest, intuiation, vision and luck play important roles. New things could show up and the scientists are also suprised about their own findings. In this regard, this kind of scientists include Geoffrey Hinton, John Hopfield, Victor Ambros, Gary Ruvkun and David Baker. They all have their beliefs when they are young, and they keep working on that and insist for many years. They have step by step progress and some of them are super important and amazing for the human beings and attract more scientists to the field too. All are start from the belief of their own or very few people from tens of years ago.</p>
<p>But two awardees for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry indicated a new paradigm of scientific findings. Demis Hassabis and John M. Jumper are from Google DeepMind. Their work is not a small belief. In contrast, it is a goal that many researchers are dreaming. They are not alone on their way. They attacted a huge amount of resources, money, humans to create AlphaFold, the wonderful protein struction prediction tool. Also, it only took them 4 years from publishing their work to getting the Nobel Prize. These means a lot. I want to say is that the era is changing. Now, the paradigm of scientific finding is more open, bigger and maybe without a hypothesis. </p>
<p>But if I focus on the common features of these awardees. They all have a big dream and a specific target. Then what’s next? If I have no technical limitation, what do I want to do? I think the most cool thing is … Imagine that by dialing, people entity can transit in any time to any space. Forget about the dimension of time first, if we want to transit people in any space fast, there are these steps as I image: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>the human body proteins info need to be decode and encode to a new coding system. </p>
</li>
<li><p>the new code can be transfer in wireless and fast. </p>
</li>
<li><p>the new code need to be translated back to biology language and used to print out or synthesis protein in seconds.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Decoding of human’s biological info is a huge work. This includes the elements (cells, neurons, chemical stuff) and all connections. Even only sequencing a small amount of cells may need few days to finish for the most advanced sequencing machine and it follows a complicated procedure. Additionally, some protein interaction and the structure is far from described.  – No wonder why the multiple omics sequencing is so popular these years. Even though we can only ‘send out’ a C elegans, it is a breakthrough.</p>
<p>If seems only the second step is doable, by internet or radio waves. Biology code can be transfer to silicon code already. Maybe the transfering system can get optimized. </p>
<p>Fast synthesis of protein and other biological elements, or 3d printing an entity is another big challenge. </p>

          <p>This weekend, I immersed in the stories of three women. </p>
<p>Lisa Su.<br>CEO of AMD, MIT PhD. I watched her talk in MIT and a video about her and AMD. She is strong, full of logic and very smart. Her advice to the MIT PhDs: Be in Good mindset, perserverance, creative, we can make our luck. She is very confident about be a professionist is good in business than a generalist, like Harvard MBA. She also said it is really tough in MIT. She really saw what really smart is. I think tough make people strong. See smart make people smart and humble. Obviousely, Lisa and Huang can double win in the AI era. </p>
<p>Feifei Li.<br>AI starter, professor in Stanford.<br>She is really a risk taker. I do understand that how many people say no to her idea about building a 10 million image dataset. It is very common as a scientist that the idea is not accepted and supported by others. And she met some general and specific problems, grant, having kids, feel frastrated about potential wrong leading, the sense of this dataset, etc.. I can see her story telling is very attractive. </p>
<p>black women movie<br>I watched a movie, ‘The Help’. It tells a story about a white girl interviewed many black maids and want to help people know their suffer. Black maids are integrity and clever too. It is very touched to see that people become more respectful and become real people. The man in the movie judged the girl that ‘initially it is nothing, but why you write the book’. In his mind, the unfair is a normal thing. I am glad they two hate each other. I am more glad that the girl’s mother beat Hilly in her way and feel proud of her daughter. I think she woke up her human nature, showing integrity and bravery. Women help women. Brava!</p>

          <p>We always hear: keep doing and you will get a lot. This is actually describe the benefit from compounding interest, in other words, power of time. But it is not intuitive how much I can get. If not clear enough, our brain will not set the specific goal and really make it. To specify this effect, let’s apply it in calculating the retirement saving. If you can put the specific amount of money (here 50k) every year with specific compounding interest (here 3% per year) until you are 55 years old (here start saving at 2 years old). Let’s see.</p>
<p>First, creat a class called power_of_time, it can also be used to minic compounding interet effect of doing exercise, writing, reading, etc…</p>

<p>So if I save 50k per year from I am 27 with 3% interest rate, I will have 2328800 when I am 55, 1.606 times of initial saving money!<br>I think precisely know the benefit will make people feel more safety when they save and spend money. And every time when saving, the reward of doing so is amplified, because oringinally it could happen after like 30 years! This positive feedback make people easier to persist and enjoy the moment. </p>
<p>I want to make the ‘power_of_time’ class be applied more in my life. In addition, about object-oriented programming, it is better for an object, which have many properties and also some specific methods. ‘Class’ is easy to expand and also do team coding. Usually use ‘handle’ when define it, so the changing of properties will be assigned to the initial. Properties, as the name, show the properties of the object. And methods could be many functions that can be used to the object. Usually the first function is to generate an example of the class, obj, and meanwhile initialize the properties.</p>

          <p>Basically, conda is a tool to manage virtual environments, which can have different versions of python or other packages. ‘Virtual’ is not really virtual. It actually installed the needed packages in different path. ipython is an interactive python terminal, which is based on python interpreter (can be understanded as python.exe in base or one vertual environment). spyder is a platform to write script, run code in console, check variables in the workspace, etc.. It also runs based on a python interpreter and specific environment. Only need to install spyder in the base, then install spyder kernels for the environment and edit the python interpreter and start new kernel in the launched spyder. </p>
<p>So the basic steps of setting a new environment is to 1. create env, 2. install packages and ipython. 3. set the python interpreter and console in spyder. Also, after creating environment, need to add the path to the environment variables in the windows “advanced system setting” (C:\Users\zhang\anaconda3\envs\tf\Lib\site-packages, C:\Users\zhang\anaconda3\envs\tf\Lib, C:\Users\zhang\anaconda3\envs\tf\Scripts, C:\Users\zhang\anaconda3\envs\tf\Library, C:\Users\zhang\anaconda3\envs\tf\Library\bin). </p>
<p>These days, I am trying to analyze the behavioral structure based on the DLC tracking data. Some machine learning methods need to be used. Here, just wrote down some experience of packages install. On the one hand, I am using VAME, which do RNN and autoencoder under the pytorch structure and some visualization tool, like umap. On the other hand, I will use tensorflow LSTM. To manage packages, I create Anaconda environments on Windows 10 for both. Actually I did on two PCs, VAME on the GPU and tensorflow on my laptop (only CPU).</p>
<pre><code># if you tried the same env with similar name before but it does not work, can clear it in conda prompt before try new one.
conda remove --name tf-cpu --all</code></pre><p>After create the environment, activate it and install packages. For VAME install, follow the instruction on their github, then edit the error according to error info. Usually some text error, like in the yaml config file, “sklearn” need to change to “scikit-learn”. The same problem also need to be editted in the installation file, here it is ‘setup.py’. Then when it installed umap, the eroor is sth like “importlib.metadata can not be found” and it is point to the umap <strong>init</strong> file. I checked the importlib.metadata, and it is really not easy to found by eye that for python versions earlier than 3.8, this package is importlib_metadata ( _ there but not .). I did install importlib_metadata and importlib-metadata, so I change the . to _ then it work. I would see some <strong>tiny difference of text</strong>, because they update new versions and have new dependencies quickly.</p>
<p>For tensorflow installation:</p>
<pre><code># In conda prompt, create a new environment for tf. 
conda create --name tf
activate tf
conda search tensorflow # search for the available version of tf in anaconda, then choose the version you like
conda install tensorflow=2.10.0
conda install ipython # install ipython for this environment, so I can enter ipython not enter the base env ipython
pip install spyder-kernels==2.2.* # install kernels for using this virtual env in spyder

# after install, can test in the ipython and spyder
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)</code></pre><p>To work on the tf env in spyder, activate the env in conda, then launch spyder by click, and in spyder, go to tools -&gt; preference -&gt; Python interpreter -&gt; change it to the path of python.exe in the virtual env (C:/Users/zhang/anaconda3/envs/tf/python.exe). Then start a new console under this interpreter.</p>

          <p>proof by contradiction (反证法)<br>The statement is: There are infinite prime numbers(质数有无限多个)</p>
<p>Assume that there are limited prime numbers，p1, p2, …, pr in order<br>Then there is a number p = p1<em>p2</em>… * pr + 1,<br>As pr is the biggest prime number, so p is not prime number. Then p should be rewriten as the multiplication of the existed prime numbers. But the given expression of p show it cannot. Because it is with a +1.<br>the assumption is wrong.<br>Proved! there are infinite prime numbers. </p>
<p>There are also an interesting story in this chapter. Holmes and Watson go camping and slept in a tent. At midnight, Holmes wake up and asked Watson to tell him what did her see. Watson looked at the beautiful sky and answered very detailed inference according to her rich knowledge about stars, constellation, astronomy, meteorology and time. She was very proud of herself and asked back what did Holmes see. Holmes wry smiled and said, Waston you idiot, it means our camp was stolen. </p>
<p>I leared that to proof a statement, can create a variable based on the constrain and well-known truth, then try to overthrow the opposite statement. <strong>Creat the variable</strong> is the important step in the whole process! Can try in other questions. </p>
<p>I am always thinking, mathematic statement are based on the answer is just yes or no. But like in neuroscience, the questions are complex, “high dimensional”. For example, does APC helpful in treating epilepsy? This question is still too broad. To narrow down, we can ask: does APC helpful in rescueing recurrent seizures in the KA model? Then, to find the answer, we need to manipulate the APC, which means there are detailed choices, electrical stimulation, chemogenetics, optogenetics, pharmalogical approaches. We can then narrow down the hypothesis or statement to “inhibiting APC by chemogenetically activating PV interneurons is helpful in rescueing recurrent seizures in the KA model.” Then the animal model can be built and the manipulation can be executed. Then it need a reliable way to assess the recurrent seizures. So we record and analyze the EEG. The results show that seizures get less, which is contradict to the contradictory statement “inhibiting APC by chemogenetically activating PV interneurons is NOT helpful in rescueing recurrent seizures in the KA model.” So we proved our initial statement.<br>It seems just play with the words of direct proof and proof by contradiction. we don’t even need to create new variables. If we think of it in the another way, we exciting APC and record the seizures and found that exciting APC do make seizure worse. We still cannot say inhibiting APC can improve seizure. It seems narrow down to specific question and direct proof is dominant.</p>

          <p>每年的小作文都要迟到一些，去年甚至没写。这里一块回顾一下吧 (自认为记性很好hahaha)</p>
<p>2022 是非常特殊的一年，处在疫情笼罩下已经第三年，政策不稳定没有人知道还要持续多久。好在我有稳定的学习研究环境。年初3个月，我安排紧凑的完成了learning课题的实验，并用我的数据分析技能快速的拿到了一些结论。确实感受到了play with data的快乐。再次验证了从data -&gt; result -&gt; knowledge 的转化不是那么轻松的。4月起开始弄D4课题的急性记录的分析，可以说是两周之内完成雏形并进行了一次优化，拿出了图。我对自己handle数据的能力更加自信了。后面在一定的压力下，不得不转而开始弄战线拉的很长的PV癫痫课题。用整个5月加入了功能连接这部分的分析。6月反思发现错误并完善了一次。兴奋和不确定并行，体会颇深。7，8月完成了初稿，同时和导师讨论后补了几次实验。9月补了一批记录。这些过程我深刻的理解到知识是怎么来的，用多个指标，多次实验验证自己的结论，并且把它放到一个大的科研背景下去考虑。并行而来的是从6月开始计划的康奈尔之行。得到了两边导师和同学（穗红）的很多帮助。有了大致的规划。10月开始了我的第一次一个人出国游学。三个月以来认识了康村NBB的一批新同学，Xinyue, LiuCan, Hongyu, Wenbo, Zhilei, Wenshuai, Yating, Heidi, Jason, 还有可爱又成熟的武汉小妹妹Alicia和一个陌生人ABC。 和每个同学的交流都让我受益匪浅。有些人哪怕没有深入交流，我也感受到了他们生活的气质和自信，比如David实验室的几位本科生。很开心的还有认识了几位爬山好友，文科生和理科生确实有着完全不同的生活和工作习惯。多了一丝对平行世界的人的了解和兴趣。康村超级棒，自信的Yapici， Linda和Aza，随性的Antonio，夸张且爱博眼球的Joe Fetro，精英气质侧漏的Jesse，很专业但是有点冷的Alex Kwan。最重要的是我的导师，非常高效善良，有点内向的David，还有他nice的家人们。另外还有来自南美洲朋友带给我的感动，热情随性且成熟的巴西室友和朋友们。华盛顿之行和夏村也收获多多，了解到了JC lab 的风格和在美国科研圈如何受到respect。 听到chuiwen, JC, 明娜这些人的故事本身就很棒。 听到了更多的研究，有些研究就是一听就很来电的感觉，比如Weinan的。康村的科研浇灌让我非常受益。回来后还参加了多人推荐的neuromatch。2022年我的科研训练确实走到了新的一步，写文章，开始思考presentation，认识同行（约30人）。现在看到每个人名我都能停下想想曾经的谈话和故事。短短3个月的离开，丰富了自己，增加了和两边导师的信任，也等来了开关。</p>
<p>2023年年初从美国回来后回家过年再回到香港已经2月（话说刚回香港也是奇妙的体验，喧嚣的街道，熟悉的湿热感和大巴车尾气，也有了晚上运动和恢复肌肉的一周。备份数据和报销等事务就同步完成了）。2月重启了我在香港的科研。为了找回状态，我用规律的时间完成了大量的果蝇课题的标注工作。并以此进入状态。文章的拒稿让我意识到，所有自己有疑惑的地方都会在审稿人眼里被放大。所以，最真实的面对自己的工作吧。2月中到3月我重构了代码，完成了新的记录数据的重新分析和数据展示。我当时对进度十分满意。4月开始构思PCA分析并开始了个导师的一对一meeting。4月其实花了三周在果蝇课题上，准备了四月底的那次presentation。也体会到了chatGPT在模块编程上的牛逼之处。3月4月和姐姐讨论了很多生成式AI的东西，感觉最强烈的时候每天都有一种焦虑和兴奋，感觉会有大事发生。5月从广州旅游回来之后我觉得很累，可能是感冒了。但是就慢慢进入状态分析了PCA。但是当时只是直觉让我这么做，还是没有想好怎么把这部分结果写进故事。6月我基本完成了文章修改。7月迎来了暑假，我参加了Neuromatch课程。这个暑营太充实了。感受到了共同学习的快乐！来自不同背景的同学们思考方式真的会不同，Linda，Park，Lacshana是很棒的共同学的伙伴。还有group coding的work方式。我觉得我提供了原始的idea，我的队友们非常高效的交流和工程化的实现了项目。Lily和Samuel做队友超级棒。我们的TA也是一个又cool又美的经历非常丰富的同学。3周扩展了computational neuroscience的了解，验证了自己的做项目思路，产生了DDM解释我的learning data的思路。由于7月的课程投稿也就耽误了。我们终于在8月中提交到了elife.这次我们没有得到很有效的意见。但是我自己很努力的想了所有能优化的地方，再加上8月底的心理课程，修改进度慢了挺多。终于再9月20号才完成提交，这次是JN。我们得到了一次很认真的审稿，模糊的东西都会在投稿中得到放大。虽然我不觉得审稿人在epilepsy方面很专业，但是他们确实提出了他们阅读中感到模糊的地方。这也促使我一条一条的去改进。我们是10月18号收到的拒稿回复。这是我第3次收到回复了，心态已然平和了很多。可以直接面对问题，想办法做或者改。此时离出发去SfN还剩3周。我在10月26号前除了心里酝酿如何改进之外，在做food learning grant review 相关的工作。后面就剩下两周了，主要修改了patch部分的分析。最后几天就要出发的时候，我完成了power部分的检查和分析，加入了z scale， 又重新分析了PCA，结果才终于确定。我到这时才觉得PCA真的是帮助到我们理解数据的，是很增色的一部分。最后几天快快的赶完poster甚至都没有时间练习。但是我觉得这两周非常高效。后面SfN阶段仿佛换了个人，丝毫不疲惫也没有时差，很兴奋的接受了大量的信息输入。和熟悉的同行加深交流，也认识了一些新同行。听着同龄人讲他们的工作，我觉得自己是快乐的，neuroscience是一个有趣的群体。对专业的excitation和mission有增无减。面对大佬James M的肯定确实是备受鼓舞。见到了康村的老朋友，听到他们的工作很快乐，可能对熟悉的人的工作也更容易产生连接吧。一周半的科研和旅游盛宴，新东西不断的撞击着我，产生着共鸣和新的连接。这感觉棒极了。11.20刚回来香港调时差休整的时候，我第一次面对挚爱的亲人的离世。恍然在11月底回到家中。已经10年没有在这个时间回家了。我的爷爷是全世界最棒的爷爷，死亡并不可怕，爷爷的善良，责任，远见，耐心已经深刻的刻印在我和姐姐的心里。知道死亡的平常，但是依然心疼被病痛折磨的没有尊严的爷爷。全家在一起，反思，深聊，眼泪让我们更加坚强。12月初再返回香港。经过一周心态调整，同时也整理和分享了SfN的收获，才再次回到投稿状态。其实只花了三天就改完了文章。和导师来往修改一轮，终于在冬至12.23这一天发出去了。每次投稿都让我用finally这个词，是因为多次的审核真是为了读者能体验好一点点。只有从对更大群体的价值我才能体会到做这件事的意义。在跨年之际，姐姐也要北上北京工作了。我们达成了一致： 拥抱变化。</p>
<p>这一年开启了一些新的习惯，听播客。现在这个大众创新的时代真不错，放学以后，硅谷101，Tianyu2FM, Lex Fridman, 无人知晓，知行小酒馆。带给我很多共鸣。播客往往是最快的新的思想，书给我稳定的内核。知行合一是最好的道路。感谢陪伴，分享，相互带来新奇体验的好友们！Let’s create more stories in the new year! </p>
<p>2024，来了</p>

          <p>This article is from Nature - light people, an interview of Prof. Eric Betzig. He tells us his “true life”, not just pass through. Nobel award, five children, science and technology, father’s company.</p>
<p>The interview is quite interesting.<br><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-023-01205-3#:~:text=Eric%20Betzig%2C%20who%20shared%20the,Bell%20Labs%20before%20turning%2035" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-023-01205-3#:~:text=Eric%20Betzig%2C%20who%20shared%20the,Bell%20Labs%20before%20turning%2035</a>.</p>
<p>The points hit me the most:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>cross-disciplines.</strong> But I find that the breakthroughs in science happen when people interact at the interface between very different disciplines that don’t necessarily have a clear connection. To this day, anything that I’ve succeeded within sciences is by getting out of my comfort zone and learning more about some field that has nothing to do with optics, and how optics can be applied to it.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>flexibly minded.</strong> You have to fill your mind with ideas and thoughts, and creatively think about how different things can be combined. I think that’s why I enjoyed working at Bell Labs so much, because it was a place where cell biologists, neurobiologists, computer scientists, material scientists all worked under the same roof and it was amazing what breakthroughs were made just having people talking to each other. So I want to warn against siloization in scientific research. Don’t just have people studying the same discipline in one institution, or don’t just have people chasing preset goals. Encourage outside thinkers. It’s good to have a goal, but you never know what’s gonna help you get to that goal. And sometimes goals may not have been intelligently chosen, and it can put blinders on you. You have to be flexibly minded in science.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>question and different disciplines.</strong> I believe to make a good scientific investigator, you need to be open-minded, and have the willingness and ability to talk to many other people of different disciplines, which is the secret to creativity and innovativeness. Knowing the problem is often half of the solution, so you should always have in your mind a set of important and impactful problems that you don’t know how to answer. Then, by putting yourself in a position where you are exposed to different people from different disciplines, you’ll find that creativity will come naturally because if you have the problem in your head, your subconscious starts to think about what you can do to solve this problem. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>work hard and success.</strong> To succeed, you just have to work really hard, make sure your brain is completely immersed in the problem or a number of problems, and then luck will come. But luck does not determine whether you’ll be successful. Hard work determines whether you’re going to be successful or not. Luck determines what you will be successful at. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>exponential curve of intelligence.</strong> It’s (the “It” is hard working) the only correlate I know to success. It has nothing to do with intelligence or where you’re working. It’s nonlinear, because the more you know, the more efficient you get in finding out even more. So it goes in pretty much an exponential curve, not a linear curve, with output.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>perseverance and quit.</strong> Perseverance doesn’t mean staying in the same job forever, nor does it mean focusing on the same problem, because sometimes problems have dead ends. Perseverance means focusing on the science or what motivates you in your career. I will agree that the hardest thing for me has been to know when to quit for exactly that reason because you’re taught: persevere, persevere, persevere. So it was a tough decision to quit Bell Labs and an even tougher decision to leave my dad’s company. At Bell Labs at least I knew that I had taken that near field technique as far as it could go. I knew that I wasn’t going to be able to break the laws of physics. So it wasn’t as difficult a decision to say, “Forget perseverance, I’m quitting there.” Because I felt like I had done everything I could do.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>risk takers and truly alive.</strong> When I ended my Nobel talk, I dedicated it to all the people who took a risk and failed, because though you don’t hear about them, they are more important because there’re more of them than people who took a risk and succeeded. You can go a whole career having a bunch of good half-baked ideas and never find the key. But I still encourage my students to take risks. When you take a risk, particularly a risk for your career, it usually brings out your best self. When you take a risk and initially fail, you’ll work your absolute hardest to try to succeed and that’s when you find your limits. It’s being alive, about being truly alive as opposed to kind of just passing through life.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>luck and scientific question.</strong> I felt I was very lucky to go to graduate school in 1982 and pick microscopy as a field. That was a lucky decision because it was right at the time that personal computers were available to automate microscopes, when the CCD chip was just becoming available, when fluorescence was starting to take off, and when lasers were cheap enough that they could go in individual labs. So being at the start of your career in 1980 and choosing microscopy is like being a physicist in 1920 and deciding to study quantum mechanics. That’s the way microscopy was in 1980, just a fruit waiting to be plucked. I was just lucky to have picked the right area.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>People are people.</strong> From a science side, I don’t really have a hero. One of the sobering things I feel about winning the Nobel Prize is I’ve had close contact with lots of famous people, scientists, politicians, etc. It’s scary how ordinary most of them seem. They’re not smarter. They’re not more beneficent. They don’t have deeper thoughts. They’re just people. People are people and whether they’re Nobel laureates, the President of the United States, or a billionaire, they’re all people and humans are very limited. Often, when people have success, they tend to forget their limitations, and extrapolate from their success in one area into expertise or proficiency in other areas in which they are not expert. I’m very cognizant of my many limitations, and the only time I’m willing to talk authoritatively is about microscopy because that’s the one area I feel like I’m competent to have an opinion on.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>talk to people with different background.</strong> How much do you hang out with chemists and biologists and data scientists and mathematicians and so forth? That’s why I always loved Bell Labs, where cell biologists, neurobiologists, computer scientists, material scientists all worked under the same roof and ate lunch together at the same table.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>risk, vigor and creativity.</strong> Don’t be afraid to take risks. There’s always a way to recover from a failure. Life is short, so live it with all the vigor and creativity you can.</p>
</li>
