        <p>Although I did not have a Barbie doll when I was a child, I do know that Barbie doll is a perfect image for many girls. BTW, I have Panpan (my panda doll). Barbie movie shows two new sights - (1) what would a matriarchy world look like, Barbieland. (2) what would happen when the two world have interactions, including the effect on women (Barbie) and men (Ken) in the Barbieland And the effect on women (Gloria and Sasha) and men in power (Mattel people) in the real world. </p>
<p>At the start, the movie shows how the people’s life in the Barbieland look like. Barbies get up, dress up, make up, eat up and go to work. In that world, Barbies are very popular and respected. When I see Barbie can always say no to Ken and Kens are mouth fighting just for getting more attention from Barbies, I don’t know why I feel good. And then I realize something wrong in the Barbieland too. It shows exactly the opposite of some of our real world. In the Barbieland, most people do not have their “self”. They don’t have their own name and they all wear similar and dress up similar. Except Allan (Ken’s friend) and non-traditional Barbie. Allan is a special male charator. He seems well fitted in Barbie’s world and always know his self even when Barbie’s world is led by Kens. The non-traditional Barbie is a pecial female charator. She knows what happened to Barbie’s change (always want to die and the feet change) and how to fix it. She also not be brain washed by Kens. </p>
<p>When they go to the real world, Ken and Barbie feel totally different things. Barbie always want to fix the problem of the corresponding person in the real world. But Ken feels the happy from patriarchy. When they speak out their findings together, Ken immediately followed Barbie. He still think he is Barbie’s Ken. But the short experience in the real world is definitely a seed. He feels good about man’s power and go back to Baibie’s world before Barbie to construct Ken’s world. For Barbie, she is so upset in the real world, because she found it is not like what she thinks about. She is not popular, she is not respected, always get weird attention and actions. However, she met two people who are amazing for her. Both are old ladies. The first one show when Barbie is trying hard to connect to a person in the real world. After she think hard and felt the same pain from the real human and she wake up with tears. She see the old lady sits on the other end of the bench. Looks very calm and beautiful. Barbie tells her she lookes very beautiful. She smiled and said Yes. I think this is the first time that Barbie think that good about women in the real world can be good, not like what she experienced. Another lady is in the Mattel building, the old lady who saved Barbie and tell her she is beautiful. In the end of the movie, the lady shows up again. She is the creator of Barbie dolls. So when Ken in the real world, he found power. For Barbie, she found unperfectness.</p>
<p>When humans go to the Barbieland, the girl’s mom speak out the embarrassed situation of women in the real world. It is very tough in the real world. It seems everything women do is wrong. Need to be…, But not too… Her daughter and her think they hate each other in the real life, but when they are in very difficult cases, they have special chemistry. Sasha(the daughter) express her love to her mom (Gloria), telling her she is a hero, encouraging her to save Barbieland. So they together save Barbieland and also their own relationship. </p>
<p>For the Mattel people, it is ironically that they are in the high position but their behavior are funny and stereotyped. They are played by Barbie because they are too care about their appearance and their social identity. They also try to look nice to all people, which is for hiding the ugly and maintaining their power. In a short time that Ken experience in the real world, he finds even though it is Men’s world, no people cares Kens who has no special skills. The game of power is not fun at all. </p>
<p>It is ironic that human world and also barbieland is easy to show brain wash. Individual is not their “self”, they are just an object of the world. In the real world, even though people has their own name, own preference of clothes, make up, food and so on, it is also easy to follow the expectation of the society when choosing their life. More work or more family, more social or more self. Here are two very touched points about SELF. First, when Barbie experienced all, she sincerely says sorry to Ken because she always takes everything for granted before. And then Ken noticed that he is not Barbie’s Ken. Ken is just Ken. Another time I got teary eyes is that Barbie noticed that she can be a real human as long as she wants. No need any approvement. I think it is what the movie want to tell us. You have all your life. You are your SELF. </p>
<p>The movie shows new sights full of details. I strongly feel that communication is important in development. Communication always drives change. Problems are nowhere to hide. As long as people communicate in a rational way with respect, the things would be better. In the end of the movie, Barbie goes to the real world. She changes the name to Barbra and not wearing the typical pink. However, the first thing she do is to go to the gynecologist. Why? </p>
<p>(My guess is that Barbie is too curious about the women organ? Suppose that, a person can change to a bird, the first thing is the wings. If can change to a toy car, the first thing is the fast wheels. This shows the cute part of Barbie. Or maybe she want to have ability of having a baby.)</p>
